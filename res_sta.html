    <h3>Data analysis technique: toward the precise determination of $\left|V_{cb}\right|$
        using the Oktay-Kronfeld action</h3>

    My collaborators in LANL/SWME and I am having been worked for the calculation of
    $\left|V_{cb}\right|$. 
    For the heavy (light) quark, we are using the
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0523" target="_blank">Oktay-Kronfeld action</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0610092" target="_blank">HISQ action</a>).
    For the sea quark, we use the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4768" target="_blank">MILC HISQ ensemble</a>.
    <br/>
    
    During the Ph.D. course days, I have mainly worked on the data analysis
    technique. 
    For the determination of $\left|V_{cb}\right|$ combining
    with the experimental result, we need to calculate semileptonic form
    factor such as $\bar{B}\to D^{\ast}\ell\bar{\nu}$ at the zero recoil
    ($w=1$). 
    For it, we need to perform the 3pt correlation function
    fit on the four channels: $B\to D^{\ast}$, $D^{\ast}\to B$, $B\to B$,
    $D^{\ast}\to D^{\ast}$. 
    Here, we do not use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2519" target="_blank">$\bar{R}^{\frac{1}{2}}$
        constant fit method</a>. 
    We use linear fit of
    matrix elements for ground state or excited states, using fitting
    parameters of 2pt correlator fit as input parameters.
    <br/>
    
    Hence, we need to perform the 2pt correlator fit first. We use sequential
    Bayesian method. For the least $\chi^{2}$ fitting, we use Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
    algorithm, which is a quasi-Newton method. 
    Any Newton method need
    its initial guess. If we do not feed good initial guess ($\chi^{2}$-IG)
    to the $\chi^{2}$ minimizer, then the computing time increases. But
    if we feed good initial guess to the $\chi^{2}$ minimizer, then we
    can save computing time dramatically. 
    By this reason, we additionally
    introduced Newton method to our 2pt correlation function fit. Note
    that Newton method needs its own initial guess (N-IG). 
    To put N-IG
    within the radius of convergence, we further introduce scanning method.
    <br/>
    
    To solve the Newton method, we need multiple time slices which is
    equal to the number of fitting parameters. 
    Those time slices can be
    chosen within the fit range. By this, we have multiple time slice
    combinations. Before the least $\chi^{2}$ fitting, we try Newton
    method for all possible such time slice combinations. 
    If the Newton
    method finds roots, we save them. Or we abandon that time slice combination.
    In the coarse lattice, at the final step of the sequential Bayesian
    method, Newton method find $O\left(10^{4}\right)$ roots. 
    In order
    to monitor statistics for the $\chi^{2}$ distribution, we randomly
    select $O\left(10^{3}\right)$ roots among them, for example.
    <br/>
    
    By this kind of combination of scanning method, Newton method and
    sequential Bayesian method, we can find global minimum and local minima
    of $\chi^{2}$, consuming up all possible time slices. I updated our
    fitting code. 
    I developed and applied multidimensional iterative scanning
    method to our fitting code. 
    And I applied multidimensional Newton
    method to our fitting code. 
    <br/>
    
    Through these accomplishments, I am interested in the combinations of two or more various algorithms to compensate each other, such as sequential Bayesian method and Newton method.
